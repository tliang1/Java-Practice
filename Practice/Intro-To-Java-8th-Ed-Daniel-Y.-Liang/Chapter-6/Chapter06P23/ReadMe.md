100 Lockers Puzzle

A school has 100 lockers and 100 students. All lockers are closed on the first day of school. As the students enter, the first student opens every locker. Then the second student begins with the second locker and
closes every other locker. The third student begins with the third locker and changes every third locker (closes it if it was open, and opens it if it was closed). The fourth student begins with the fourth locker and
changes every fourth locker. The fifth student starts with the fifth locker and changes every fifth locker, and so on, until the hundredth student changes the hundredth locker. After all the students have passed 
through the building and changed the lockers, which lockers are open?
